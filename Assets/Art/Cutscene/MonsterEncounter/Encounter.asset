    lines: Without any warning, it prowled right at me with no hesitation. Its explosive
      power was almost equivalent to one full adult male. Its hand grasped onto my

      of event I anticipated to witness; my mother would always tell me to cover
      it up, or else something despicable will happen to me, abandonment was also
      not out of the question. Even if I was both a worhsipper for Lord Arva and
      Lord Nokru.
